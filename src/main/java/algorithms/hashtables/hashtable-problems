what are the 5 most asked coding problems for hashtables?

1. Implement a Hash Table
2. Design a Hash Table with Separate Chaining
Separate Chaining technique combines a linked list with a hash table in order to resolve the collision.
This method uses extra memory to resolve the collision.
The time complexity of both searching and deleting a element in the hash table is O(n), where n is the number of keys hash to the same slot.

3. Find the Closest Match in a Hash Table
4. Implement LRU Cache Using a Hash Table
5. Find the Most Frequent Item in a Hash Table
