Write an SQL query to delete all the duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id. Note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.

After running your script, the answer shown is the Person table. The driver will first compile and run your piece of code and then show the Person table. The final order of the Person table does not matter.

Example 1:

Input:
Person table:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
| 3  | john@example.com |
+----+------------------+
Output:
+----+------------------+
| id | email            |
+----+------------------+
| 1  | john@example.com |
| 2  | bob@example.com  |
+----+------------------+
Explanation: john@example.com is repeated two times. We keep the row with the smallest Id = 1.

delete p2.* from Person p1
JOIN Person p2 ON p1.Email = p2.Email
where p1.id < p2.id
