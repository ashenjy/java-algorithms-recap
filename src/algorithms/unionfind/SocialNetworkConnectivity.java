 * Question 1: Social network connectivity
 *
 * Given a social network containing N members and a log file containing M
 * timestamps at which times pairs of members formed friendships, design an
 * algorithm to determine the earliest time at which all members are connected
 * (i.e., every member is a friend of a friend of a friend ... of a friend).
 * Assume that the log file is sorted by timestamp and that friendship is an
 * equivalence relation. The running time of your algorithm should be MlogN or
 * better and use extra space proportional to N.
 */

/**
 * Solution:
 *
 * Use a union-find data structure with each site representing a social network
 * member. Add unions between sites in time order of friendships being formed.
 * After each union is added, check the number of connected components
 * within the union-find data structure. If only one, all members are connected.
 *
 * Must keep track of number of unique components. Decreases when a union occurs
 * between different components.
